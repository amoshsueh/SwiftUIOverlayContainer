/// **horizontal**: the views are arranged horizontally. Normally (spacing is greater than 0), views do not overlap each other. Internal implementation uses HStack.
///
/// **vertical**: the views are arranged vertically, under normal conditions (spacing greater than 0), there is no overlap between views. Usually used to implement information tips at the top or bottom of the screen. The internal implementation uses VStack.
///
/// **stacking**: Aligns the views along the Z-axis. Views will overlay each other. ZStack is used for internal implementation. When ContainerViewQueueType is oneByeOne or oneBy

///
/// **oneByOne**: Only one view can be displayed at a time. When the container receives a new view, the current view will be canceled and the new view will be displayed.
///
/// **oneByOneWaitFinish**: Only one view can be displayed at a time. The new view needs to wait for the current view to be closed (user manual, Binding value, auto dismiss) before it can be displayed.

/// **multiple**: Multiple views can be displayed at once. The display result depends on the containerViewDisplayType.
